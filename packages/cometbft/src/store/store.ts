/*
BlockStore is a simple low level store for blocks.

There are three types of information stored:
  - BlockMeta:   Meta information about each block
  - Block part:  Parts of each block, aggregated w/ PartSet
  - Commit:      The commit part of each block, for gossiping precommit votes

Currently the precommit signatures are duplicated in the Block parts as
well as the Commit.  In the future this may change, perhaps by moving
the Commit data outside the Block. (TODO)

The store can be assumed to contain all contiguous blocks between base and height (inclusive).

// NOTE: BlockStore methods will panic if they encounter errors
// deserializing loaded data, indicating probable corruption on disk.

// TODO: Implement
