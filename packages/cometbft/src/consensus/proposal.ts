// Proposal defines a block proposal for the consensus.
// It refers to the block by BlockID field.
// It must be signed by the correct proposer for the given Height/Round
// to be considered valid. It may depend on votes from a previous round,
// a so-called Proof-of-Lock (POL) round, as noted in the POLRound.
// If POLRound >= 0, then BlockID corresponds to the block that is locked in POLRound.
